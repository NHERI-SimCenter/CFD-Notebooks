In this regard, we can believe that our goal is to solve the Navier-Stokes equations where the unknowns are velocities and pressure.\n",

In the previous lecture, we saw that the `system` folder contains dictionaries that specify the interpolation schemes used. In this lecture, we will learn how to specify the velocities, pressures and other quantities (like turbulence parameters) at the boundaries.\n",

In general, we can say that any quantity $F$ has a specific value assigned on the patch and that does not change over the course of the simulation.\n",

Formally, the basic boundary conditions keywords include:\n",
