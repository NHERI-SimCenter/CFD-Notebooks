About OpenFOAM
-----------------

OpenFOAM (Open Source Field Operation And Manipulation) is a free, open-source software that uses Finite Volume Method to numerically solve differential equations. It is often used for calculation of problems related to fluid mechanics. It is a collection of C++ programs representing the solvers and the utilities used for data manipulation. Along with solvers and utilities, OpenFOAM also has pre-processing and post-processing capabilities that allow setting up of cases, boundary conditions and also visualize the results. The general structure of OpenFOAM is described in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}.

Jupyter Notebooks
-------------------

JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab is extensible and modular: write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones.
