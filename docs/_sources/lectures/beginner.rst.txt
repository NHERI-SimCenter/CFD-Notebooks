Beginner lectures
===================

In this beginner series on OpenFOAM, we will help you understand the structure of the OpenFOAM directories and file system, creating boundary conditions, setting up a mesh using ``blockMesh`` and ``snappyHexMesh`` utilities. By the end of the lecture series, you should be able to run sample cases on Designsafe cyberinfrastructure hosted by TACC supercomputer Stampede2.

Learning objectives
---------------------
Upon completion of this beginner series, you should have the ability to:

* Modify the files and file directories of OpenFOAM
* Modify and setup boundary conditions
* Mesh using ``blockMesh`` and ``snappyHexMesh`` utilities
* Run OpenFOAM jobs on supercomputing cluster Stampede2
* Be exposed to Agave API and Jupyter notebooks
* Visualize OpenFOAM results using Paraview

Pre-requisites
----------------
This is a beginner series in OpenFOAMbut requires a basic knowledge of:

* Fluid Mechanics
* Basic knowledge of using a computer
