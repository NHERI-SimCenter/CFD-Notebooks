Tsunami events
========================

The major areas of the world that experience strong activity with potential for tsunami are along the boundaries of the Pacific ocean with other regions. However, in general, tsunamis can be generated in any coastal area, including inland seas and large lakes. The below image, sourced from NOAA, maps some of the trunami-prone regions in the world.

There are good records for recent tsunamis. However, for those in the past centuries, these are mostly based on the accounts of personal observations. The below image shows the tsunami events caused due to earthquakes/volcanic eruptions/landslides/other causes between 1610 B.C. to 2017 A.D. The events are classified based on magnitude and cause by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The tabular data below, compiled by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) under the UNESCO/IOC-NOAA partnership, provides a glossery of tsunami events over the last 2000 years. Tsunamis that have a travel time of 1-3 hours are classified as regional tsunamis and major ones over the last 2000 years are shown below.

The destruction caused by a tsunami can range to much larger extents. The tsunami that cause damage in regions beyond three hour of travel are classified as distant/teletsunami.

Tsunamis can be caused due to a variety of events. While majority of them are caused due to earthquakes, they also result due to volcanic eruptions, landslides and other events. These are shown below and it is evident that most of these events are also in neighbourhood of the Pacific ocean.
