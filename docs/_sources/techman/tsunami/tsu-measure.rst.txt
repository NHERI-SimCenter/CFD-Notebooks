Tsunami Measurements
========================

One of the important aspect is related to the measurement of Tsunami. There are three definitions that are considered for the water level. The first is the "Inundation height". The inundation height is the height from the normal water level to the top of the flooded water level. 

The second measure is the "Inundation depth". This is the distance from the ground surface to the top of the flooded water level. 

The last measure is known as the "Run-up height". This is the height of the normal water level to the water level where the tsunami stops. This is important to gauge the overall tsunami energy.
