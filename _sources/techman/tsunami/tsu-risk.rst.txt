Tsunami Risk Management
========================

Tsunami risk assessment and management includes four stages:

* **Survey:** In the first stage, a survey of existing structural heights is conducted. Further on based on historical records and preliminary simulations, the necessary heights are obtained for the existing structures.

* **Off-shore simulation:** Here, the possible cases of tsunamis and storm surge are simulations and the resulting wave heights are studied.

* **Inland simulation:** Here the resulting flood is simulated to calculate the possible and projected flood depths, velocity, time-series of flood etc.

* **Time requirement:** Finally, the time needed for evacuation and possible loss of life, in the event of a tsunami are calculated.
