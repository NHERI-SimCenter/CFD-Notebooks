Shallow Water Solvers
=======================

There are several shallow water solvers available. In this work, we have focused on two of the primary ones of interest to the community: GeoClaw and AdCirc.

GeoClaw
-----------

GeoClaw is a part of Clawpacky that was originally developed in 1994 by Prof. Randall LeVeque and co-workers. More information can be found on the website of `Clawpack <https://www.clawpack.org>`_. It is used quite often for tsunami modeling.

In this documentation, we will discuss aspects of particular importance to the Hydro-UQ platform that includes the format of the GeoClaw files.

AdCirc 
--------

AdCirc is often used for modeling storm surges.

SimCenter formats
--------------------

Development of file standards can help in the sustainable growth of community projects. SimCenter proposes the below formats for storing information related to the shallow water solvers.
