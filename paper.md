# Summary

The **CFD Notebooks** are a set of Jupyter notebooks aimed at senior undergraduate and early graduate students who are interested in learning OpenFOAM. It is aimed to allow the learner to get started with the open-source CFD tool OpenFOAM and to run it on Designsafe. It provides a foundation for all aspects of OpenFOAM, from running cases to programming, so is useful to both new users and existing users wishing to broaden their basic knowledge of OpenFOAM. The learners are exposed to running exercises and simulating cases in OpenFOAM using a HPC computing platform, accessed directly through the Jupyter notebook. The Jupyter notebooks consist of video tutorials, DIY examples, and general reading materials. This learning tool is truly platform-independent and leverages the power of HPC. At present, CFD Notebooks are hosted and uses the Designsafe's supercomputing infrastructure at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, particularly the Stampede2 and Frontera clusters.

The notebooks are broken up into various editions, each with four lessons: Beginner / Intermediate / Expert / Professional. At present, only the beginner edition is available. The beginner edition of the notebook includes four lessons:

* Lesson 1: Introduction to OpenFOAM and Designsafe

* Lesson 2: Different solvers in OpenFOAM and which to use?

* Lesson 3: Boundary conditions in OpenFOAM

* Lesson 4: Meshing in OpenFOAM (blockMesh)

# Statement of need

There are several tutorials available on Youtube, particularly with regard to the usage of OpenFOAM for CFD. This tutorial is not an alternative to these video tutorials but as a complementary to CFD courses like ``CFD Python: the 12 steps to Navier-Stokes equations'' [@Barba2019].
